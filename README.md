# FORGE
FORGE: Framework for Optimised Review &amp; Guided Engineering. In simple terms, FORGE allows users to optimise code, diagrams, workflows, UI, datasets etc. before actually implementing them. Rather than focussing on post-failure cleanups, this project focusses on design-stage intervention.
